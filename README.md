##  Stakeholder-Style Executive Summary

This dashboard shows that the business is performing well with strong year-over-year growth in sales, orders, and product volume. Revenue has crossed $484K, and profit stands at nearly $50K, reflecting a healthy but competitive market position. Technology products are the top profit drivers, while Phones and Chairs dominate product sales. Regionally, the Central and West zones generate the most revenue.

However, profit growth is not keeping pace with sales growth, which signals rising costs or pricing pressure.

These actions can help improve profitability while maintaining sales momentum.
